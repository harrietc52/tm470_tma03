## Appendix 7

Projects problem statement

Note:  This includes some features which have since been deprioritised.

Problem statement:

People who grow vegetables (growers) would like a new computer system to keep track of sow, plant and harvest dates in the year's calendar, to be reminded of these dates, to know what has been planted where and why and how much to plant per crop. 

Currently, growers use various means of note taking to keep track of this information. However, this is manual and problematic. For example, crops should not be planted in the same place year on year to allow the soil to recover, and if the previous year's notes were lost, the season's planting may not be as successful as it could be. Additionally, it is easy to forget when to sow seeds, indoors or outdoors, and habits such as sequential sowing (when crops are sown continuously throughout the season providing a more steady output of crops) are missed, because growers forget to sow. Similar opportunities are missed, if growers are not aware of the upcoming weather forecast, such as a sudden frost or dry spell, resulting in the possible loss of crops. 

The new software should resolve these problems by implementing a single allotment management system which is easy to use. The system should provide a grower with the ability to view possible crops, select the crops they would like to grow. Inputting any additional information such as variety, allowing them to add notes or images throughout the growing season. Additionally, growers should be alerted of weather warnings, and have help when plotting their patches, by tips of what crops grow well next to each other or not. Additionally, growers should have tips on companion planting, where the system would recommend what crops could be planted in and around another crop, to save space and benefit from one another. 

The system should handle usage either at home or on the allotment, on phone (iOS or Android) or directly from a web browser. Growers may only be able to have one “Plot” at any one time, but this plot can be completed, and the end of the season before starting the next. 

In the new system it must be possible to automate the creation of a Growing Timeline line, or Calendar, with a list of ToDo’s, whether it is sowing, watering, harvesting etc. The system will allow growers to check the todo’s off the timeline, and filter the timeline by month, or view the whole year at once.

Review of literature which influence the LESP project concerns is provided in Appendix 11. 


(TMA02)
The TM470 resource "Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional issues" [@open_university_legal_nodate] provided further reading into GDPR and BCS resources. As a result of the GDPR "Right to Erasure" law [@ico_right_2021], a requirement was added which allows a user to remove their location, due to it being Personally Identifiable Information (PII). As an ICO website, an independent body, one can assume it is unbias and up to date. BCS also identifies ethical characteristics for IT professionals to follow. The Code of Conduct principles are clear [@bcs_bcs_nodate] and the source credible, as the Chartered Institute for IT. 

Another OU resource "Embedding equality, diversity and inclusion in your project" didn't provide lots of information, again, provide useful resources such as W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guide [@w3c_standards_nodate]. Technical standards described are very relevant, such as making HTML and CSS accessible. A sub-page of [@equality_and_human_rights_commission_protected_nodate] clearly states what characteristics are illegal to discriminate somebody on and a useful checklist to see if a systems language is free of gender bias is provided by [@european_institute_for_gender_equality_gender-sensitive_nodate]. A recommended tool called GenderMag seemed overly complicated for this project and so I won't use this resource going forward. [@noauthor_gendermag_nodate]  Finally, an OpenLearn course "Accessibility of eLearning" is brilliant as a visual learning tool with distinguishable chapters. [@openlearn_accessibility_nodate]. As an OpenLearn course it can be assumed this is kept relevant with no bias.

## Appendix 12

 How the questionnaire was designed

* first made a list of how I manage the growing of our vegetables, what I do, don't do, know about, would like to do more of
* conducted some research in what allotment management applications exist, and what features they have
* then made a list of all possible features that might be useful
* tried to group them into categories
* final categories: General, Vegetable information, Crop Rotation, Reminders, Companion Planting, Social, Finally.
* General: two high level questions asking what does the responder use currently to managed, notes or other apps
* Vegetable information: how do they what to plant, when, and how much.
* Crop rotation: do they crop rotate and how do they keep track of what is planted where each year, to ensure that isn't planted in the same place again. This helps the soil recover
* Reminders: asking whether reminders would be useful, such as alerting users when to seed/plant/harvest would be useful
* Companion Planting: explain that companion planting is when crops are grown within each other, to support/encourage each other, and whether the responder does companion plant, and how they know what plants are good companions. e.g. lettuces benefits from the shelter of tall sweetcorn, so can be planted within the sweetcorn space. Also asked how to responders create the plot layout, considering what grows well / not well near each other. e.g. potatoes and tomatoes both suffer from blight that could easily spread from one to another if planted near by
* Social: questions about the use of social media to share vegetable growing experiences. asking what responders do with left over seeds/ vegetables
* Finally: in what location would it be used, a website or app preferred, any other recommended features, and favourite feature discussed above

* Vegetable information: how do they what to plant, when, and how much.
* Crop rotation: do they crop rotate and how do they keep track of what is planted where each year, to ensure that isn't planted in the same place again. This helps the soil recover
* Reminders: asking whether reminders would be useful, such as alerting users when to seed/plant/harvest would be useful
* Companion Planting: explain that companion planting is when crops are grown within each other, to support/encourage each other, and whether the grower does companion plant, and how they know what plants are good companions. e.g. lettuces benefits from the shelter of tall sweetcorn, so can be planted within the sweetcorn space. Also asked how to grower create the plot layout, considering what grows well / not well near each other. e.g. potatoes and tomatoes both suffer from blight that could easily spread from one to another if planted near by
* Social: questions about the use of social media to share vegetable growing experiences. asking what grower do with left over seeds/ vegetables
* Finally: in what location would it be used, a website or app preferred, any other recommended features, and favourite feature discussed above

- 
Hybrid development seems the most appropriate as there would be a single code base for all platforms, and a variety of languages and frameworks can be used. Hybrid applications also benefit from the device’s sensors, making it a fitting choice for an app which may require location data, camera facilities and notifications. (TM352) However,

| KT     | X        |          |          | Probably the 1st one as it gives a good overview at a glance. But the 2nd one would also be useful for more short term planning, like 'what do I need to do this week'                                                                                           |
| CS     | X        |          |          | I like the first format for the veg timeline/calendar, as I'm mainly concerned with a broad overview of what I need to do throughout the year. However, I'd prefer for them to be ordered from the time they first need to be seeded rather than alphabetically. |

details of learning from individual stories

_Then explored details of implementation in Rails, in particular how to realise attributes, associations and behaviour. Attribute types, user-defined types. Implemetnat associagtions with multiplicity, variable or collections, then implement operations. 

Implementation of designed solution

`npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`

all stories has - textual description/ acceptance criteria

create tab navigation
- React Navigation, also starting to understand. Original wanted no tabs showing when initially creating a user, but time boxed that and now going to check whether a user exists then render a different component, so the navigation is the same throughout
- Couldnt get navigation to work with plot vegetable component so changed approach to adding include to back end, so on getting a plot it would also get the plots vegetables info, so that can be renders in the plot pag

create user [story](https://github.com/harrietc52/TM470/issues/59)
- Install redux to persist user - do we need a user? 
- Started Sign up user. Adding scafford for Rails backend and tabs and import basic component in front end
- Struggling with getting error to be thrown, but still get response. Rails.application.config.action\_dispatch.show\_exceptions = true. Commented out in `rails_api_mysql_project/spec/requests/users_spec.rb` for now

create plot [story](https://github.com/harrietc52/TM470/issues/10) (diagrams)

The one studied in the most detail was Add vegetable to plot. We analysed it using object diagrams to illustrate the state of the system at various points, and developed a design for the interaction involved in this use case, as shown in Figure 3.

- get location [story](https://github.com/harrietc52/TM470/issues/43)

Location on a Plot was initially a user-defined type. However, after accesing the devices location, it was returned as an object with latitude and longitude, and individual big ints. Therefore a Location class isn't required, as it also do not now contain any behaviour, but instead lat and long attributes added to Plot. 

This adds constraint, that plot locations will be assumed to be in south UK, as the frost dates will be hard coded. 
Since TMA02, removed the frost locations, as struggled to find an freely available API based with UK data. frost dates - could not find api. Adding Constraint, assuming used in UK based, specificaitlly cambridgeshire, as frost dates and sow/plant/harvest dates set for all vegetbales the same (as planned for in in Risks) going to stub out the data for now, so can still use hybrid device location to get location and send to backend and store. Then will return with stubbed data about frost dates the same for every location. (covered in risks)

Attributes:
Initially it was decided sow, plant and harvest datas would be attributes on a PlotVegtable object. As it was throught these would be depended on the Plots frost dates. However, as frost dates mocked out, these dates are constant for all vegetables. Therefore the attribute can belong to the Vegetable class. 

Data types:
It wasn't clear how best store the sow, plant and harvest dates
- a range of months (jan - march)
- or a object {sow: [jan, feb, march]}
- or many lists sow: [jan, feb], plant: []
- but lists are hard to store in db
- use index as months, with strings [0,1,1,2,2,...]
    - where 0 is nothng, 1 is sow
- store as string
    - '0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,0,0'
    - parse to list
    - and assign number to task
- could develop further with enum
    - Could improve this to enum though, not int. Where sow = 1, plant 2 etc. if enum would be better 
    - sowKind = TaskKind.SOW;
- could be stored differently as config, and unlikely to change

* _LO10_ LSEPI EDI:
    * LSEPIs
        * identiified and addressed?
        * learnt alot from this activity
    * EDI
        * identiified and addressed?
    * INCLUDE
        * A proper consideration of professional issues  (see BCS Code of Conduct)

* _LO11_ solution output: _(Appendix)_
    * analyse pratical problem

    * building on skills from ou and other
        * yes, tm354 case studys, new language, 

* _LO5_ critical review tackle project:  _(Appendix)_
    * critically review how you have tackled the project 
        * EMA only, but start thinking about it after TMA03
    * observation so far
        * good start with a the idea, some research, questionaire, requirements
        * got lots of requirements as inspired from everyone saying this would be so great and useful
        * also hoped to base equally off tm352 and tm354, with containerisation and cloud deployment
        * jumped in building too quickly in a agile way
        * tma01 came around very quick and I started to panic as I didnt have much structure, and felt out of control
        * almost started again after tma01, following TM354 very strickly, and dropped tm352 apart from the odd ref
        * also changed to waterfall
        * since that, been much better at planning, workload, knowing whats coming up, what i need to work on next
        * gantt chart also good for an overview
        * with critical start dates guesing how long each feature would take
        * reduced scope meant i could imagine the finished probject which helped
        * git hub story board/ project/ milestones/cards been savour
        * impleemntation went well afetr all the planning
        * glad to have got basic html working, before adding ux
        * tried adding manually css, but quickly realised that would be too much work
        * more reflection after each story, not just in journal but in github card

Learning from making the prototype

When developing the React prototype, similar security issues to the Vue prototype resurfaced. I relaxed the CORS constraints in the back-end and added headers to requests, resulting in a different Network error: iOS does not allow HTTP requests. I then served Rails on HTTPS using a Self Signed Certificate. This worked on my laptops emulator but not my phone because the request to "localhost" from my phone, was understandably, not reaching my laptop. 

I updated the request to point to the laptops IP address. The request was now timing out which was progress. A Stack Overflow answer [@rice_answer_2019] solved this exact problem, suggesting binding the Rails server to 0.0.0.0, which was successful as my phone accessed bank-end data over the internet. This internet dependency was confirmed when developing the application in the car. I hotspotted which changed my laptops IP address because of the different network. Updating the front-end request to use the new IP successfully served the back-end data again. 

The development of working prototypes for both Vue Cordova and React Native was a big learning curve. Carrying my learning experiences from one prototype to another was rewarding. I then felt in a strong position to choose between the two, knowing they both fundamentally work.
