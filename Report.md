## Appendix 5

Projects problem statement

Note:  This includes some features which have since been deprioritised.

Problem statement:

People who grow vegetables (growers) would like a new computer system to keep track of sow, plant and harvest dates in the year's calendar, to be reminded of these dates, to know what has been planted where and why and how much to plant per crop. 

Currently, growers use various means of note taking to keep track of this information. However, this is manual and problematic. For example, crops should not be planted in the same place year on year to allow the soil to recover, and if the previous year's notes were lost, the season's planting may not be as successful as it could be. Additionally, it is easy to forget when to sow seeds, indoors or outdoors, and habits such as sequential sowing (when crops are sown continuously throughout the season providing a more steady output of crops) are missed, because growers forget to sow. Similar opportunities are missed, if growers are not aware of the upcoming weather forecast, such as a sudden frost or dry spell, resulting in the possible loss of crops. 

The new software should resolve these problems by implementing a single allotment management system which is easy to use. The system should provide a grower with the ability to view possible crops, select the crops they would like to grow. Inputting any additional information such as variety, allowing them to add notes or images throughout the growing season. Additionally, growers should be alerted of weather warnings, and have help when plotting their patches, by tips of what crops grow well next to each other or not. Additionally, growers should have tips on companion planting, where the system would recommend what crops could be planted in and around another crop, to save space and benefit from one another. 

The system should handle usage either at home or on the allotment, on phone (iOS or Android) or directly from a web browser. Growers may only be able to have one “Plot” at any one time, but this plot can be completed, and the end of the season before starting the next. 

In the new system it must be possible to automate the creation of a Growing Timeline line, or Calendar, with a list of ToDo’s, whether it is sowing, watering, harvesting etc. The system will allow growers to check the todo’s off the timeline, and filter the timeline by month, or view the whole year at once.

 **LESPI**

Review of literature which influence the LESP project concerns is provided in Appendix 11. 


(TMA02)
The TM470 resource "Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional issues" [@open_university_legal_nodate] provided further reading into GDPR and BCS resources. As a result of the GDPR "Right to Erasure" law [@ico_right_2021], a requirement was added which allows a user to remove their location, due to it being Personally Identifiable Information (PII). As an ICO website, an independent body, one can assume it is unbias and up to date. BCS also identifies ethical characteristics for IT professionals to follow. The Code of Conduct principles are clear [@bcs_bcs_nodate] and the source credible, as the Chartered Institute for IT. 

Another OU resource "Embedding equality, diversity and inclusion in your project" didn't provide lots of information, again, provide useful resources such as W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guide [@w3c_standards_nodate]. Technical standards described are very relevant, such as making HTML and CSS accessible. A sub-page of [@equality_and_human_rights_commission_protected_nodate] clearly states what characteristics are illegal to discriminate somebody on and a useful checklist to see if a systems language is free of gender bias is provided by [@european_institute_for_gender_equality_gender-sensitive_nodate]. A recommended tool called GenderMag seemed overly complicated for this project and so I won't use this resource going forward. [@noauthor_gendermag_nodate]  Finally, an OpenLearn course "Accessibility of eLearning" is brilliant as a visual learning tool with distinguishable chapters. [@openlearn_accessibility_nodate]. As an OpenLearn course it can be assumed this is kept relevant with no bias.

 How the questionnaire was designed

* first made a list of how I manage the growing of our vegetables, what I do, don't do, know about, would like to do more of
* conducted some research in what allotment management applications exist, and what features they have
* then made a list of all possible features that might be useful
* tried to group them into categories
* final categories: General, Vegetable information, Crop Rotation, Reminders, Companion Planting, Social, Finally.
* General: two high level questions asking what does the responder use currently to managed, notes or other apps
* Vegetable information: how do they what to plant, when, and how much.
* Crop rotation: do they crop rotate and how do they keep track of what is planted where each year, to ensure that isn't planted in the same place again. This helps the soil recover
* Reminders: asking whether reminders would be useful, such as alerting users when to seed/plant/harvest would be useful
* Companion Planting: explain that companion planting is when crops are grown within each other, to support/encourage each other, and whether the responder does companion plant, and how they know what plants are good companions. e.g. lettuces benefits from the shelter of tall sweetcorn, so can be planted within the sweetcorn space. Also asked how to responders create the plot layout, considering what grows well / not well near each other. e.g. potatoes and tomatoes both suffer from blight that could easily spread from one to another if planted near by
* Social: questions about the use of social media to share vegetable growing experiences. asking what responders do with left over seeds/ vegetables
* Finally: in what location would it be used, a website or app preferred, any other recommended features, and favourite feature discussed above

further learning

For the initial questionnaire, I hadn’t considered how I would analyse the results or the number of responses I would recieve. Although the 42 responses came steadily, fewer questions would have sufficed. I took this learning into the second “Timeline vs Task vs Calendar” questionnaire, which instead included one question with three multiple choice answers, which was much easier to process. (Appendix 5) What I have learnt from this is that an important factor in designing questionnaires is to think how the information will be processed.

- 
Hybrid development seems the most appropriate as there would be a single code base for all platforms, and a variety of languages and frameworks can be used. Hybrid applications also benefit from the device’s sensors, making it a fitting choice for an app which may require location data, camera facilities and notifications. (TM352) However,

| KT     | X        |          |          | Probably the 1st one as it gives a good overview at a glance.

| CS     | X        |          |          | I like the first format for the veg timeline/calendar, as I'm mainly concerned with a broad overview of what I need to do throughout the year. However, I'd prefer for them to be ordered from the time they first need to be seeded rather than alphabetically. |

| KT     | Yeah certainly gives an idea of what it does! Thoughts: 1. What happens when you click on the buttons at the bottom of the page on the 'sign up' page? Maybe doesn't need to be there? 2. When I'm on the page with heading "My Plot Name", how do I know how to add veg? (think this is through the vegetables tab but not clear from the plot page) 3. Just a tiny thing but on the 'My Tasks' wire frame youve got 'this month' highlighted but it's showing both Feb and March 4. Are the boxes with 'x' on the calendar page little pics of the page? Not super clear what they represent |
| PC     | I think the app looks great. Maybe just a list for the calendar. It seems very simple to use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| VH     | I like the overall calendar view that you can populate with the veg that you are interested in - if that could then generate a tasks/to do list I think that would be great. So essentially all starts with a list of what you want to grow - that shows up on a calendar view, auto generates a tasks list and allows you to plot the produce into your plot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Chris  | I like the first format for the veg timeline/calendar, as I'm mainly concerned with a broad overview of what I need to do throughout the year. However, I'd prefer for them to be ordered from the time they first need to be seeded rather than alphabetically. I think the mockups give a clear view of what the app will do: add a plot, add veggies to that plot, add notes about the veggies you've added, and the app will give you info about those veggies and a handy calendar view about what tasks you need to do when.                                                             |

analysis tools used in project

I am using Zotero as a reference manager and I have got better at saving the a reference to Zotero straight away from the browser plug in, and then writing up in the journal my days learning. However, I would have benefitted from adding reference specific notes at the time of saving, becuase I has been hard to remember exactly what conent was used in a reference for a particular task when it has come to writing up TMAs. Learning the PROMPT (ref) method has helped me to criticially evaluate references, something that I need to continue to work on before the EMA. Along side papers and official documentation, the project has extremely benefited from Stack Overflow posts. When I have been stuck on a particular problem, the majority of time Stack Overflow has a post discussing something similar. (Appendix xx)

Postman was a tool which also helped during development of the Rails API. (ref) It allowed me to test the API before any front-end implementation, easily adapting parameters, URLs, and checking what response and status are returned for different methods. As the Rail API was implementing a JSON API ([ref](https://jsonapi.org/format/)) the body and responses were relatively straight forward. Postman also provides automatic documentation of the requests, and therefore API, which will be used an a way of evidencing work done. The API is also a successful interface, and I like how the front-end and back-end are completely seperated. This gives me more piece of mind when I am working on a piece of code, that changes are in isolation. Additioanlly, becuase I have experience in Rails, I found it quite quick and straight forward to get the API up and working. Allowing me to focus more time on the front-end.

As for project management, I have learnt how to use Gantt charts and appreciate the value of them as I have referred back to and updated mine lots throughout the project. It was particularly useful when estimating how much development work could be completed when decidign scope. Although I have used my Project Journal increasingly more, stating what I have done each session, I have been using GitHub story cards more.

GitHub has been an invalueable tool for this project. Each sub-task has a individual card, where I have been able to add notes, images, tables etc, all in markdown so they can be copy and pasted directly into my word processor, Zettlr. This has and pulling in information for the TMAs more straight forward. The project board with column: Todo, doing and done makes it easy to see the current and upcoming state of work. Card can be moved, and therefore priotisied easily, as well as grouped into "Milestones". In my WaterScrumFall process, these have acted like stages. (appendix 30) Finally, cards can have labels, which has been useful when assigning sizes to cards, as these can be filtered easily. However, the card almost make it too easy, and it can get a little unorganised. For the final few months, I will try an maintain the journal better and organise the information I add to cards better.

* _LO5_ critical review tackle project:  _(Appendix)_
    * critically review how you have tackled the project 
        * EMA only, but start thinking about it after TMA03
    * observation so far
        * good start with a the idea, some research, questionaire, requirements
        * got lots of requirements as inspired from everyone saying this would be so great and useful
        * also hoped to base equally off tm352 and tm354, with containerisation and cloud deployment
        * jumped in building too quickly in a agile way
        * tma01 came around very quick and I started to panic as I didnt have much structure, and felt out of control
        * almost started again after tma01, following TM354 very strickly, and dropped tm352 apart from the odd ref
        * also changed to waterfall
        * since that, been much better at planning, workload, knowing whats coming up, what i need to work on next
        * gantt chart also good for an overview
        * with critical start dates guesing how long each feature would take
        * reduced scope meant i could imagine the finished probject which helped

        * impleemntation went well afetr all the planning
        * glad to have got basic html working, before adding ux
        * tried adding manually css, but quickly realised that would be too much work

MVP feedback

| Person | Feedback |
| --- | --- |
| SC  | I didn’t think the “Welcome” Page had enough on it - wasn’t that “welcoming” if you know what I mean - a few more veggie graphics & perhaps some encouraging words for those just starting out on allotment ownership… ?!? I also thought the vegetable graphics all looked the same too & would be good if they were veggie specific - possibility of any extra ?! “Top Tips” for creating excellent compost area … how to build your own shed …. Maybe links to other useful sites - eg RHS …. |
| HC  | the functionality looks like it's already really good! I feel like it is mainly visual stuff that I would edit, so as you said maybe make it less white and more green and add a few more pictures/graphics. And then the only other thing I noticed was the timetable grid is a little off, I'm not sure if it can be better aligned to have the icons directly under months? And yes the remove vegetable function I would say seems important |
| PM  | Think it's looking brilliant. Really like the timetable at the end. - Is there any way of removing/deleting a plot or veg once added? - Will there be any sort of tooltips or guidance for those that are less digitally literate? - Is there a search functionality if someone has e.g. multiple plots or multiple veg added to find which veg is in which plot etc. - Calendar function to 'look ahead' and see what's coming up in terms of planting or harvestin - Can you view vegetables before adding them to the plot? Maybe recommendations on what to plant? - Pictures of the different veg for those of us who have no idea what Swiss chard looks like - Ability to upload photos of each planted veg maybe?! |
| FC  | It's amazing, well done. Couple of notes: - Do you need a 'Sign in' button as well as a 'Sign up' button after an account has been made or are you assuming you always remain signed in? If not you could make the Welcome page more personal? So it says 'Welcome Harriet' if they add their first name. - Need a plus sign to show where you can add vegetables to the plot page. - Need a plus sign on timetable or do you click on 'seed' to add a date? - Where will the 'frost dates' appear? Will it be on the timeline- can you use a frost icon for this? |
| JO  | \- national trust green would be better than purple - I missed the location checkbox, make it bigger/ better description. - I wasn't sure how to add a vegetable to the plot, can a add button be on the plot screen. - There was no feedback when adding a veg to the plot. - Add image of veg in timeline or three letters. - When clicking on the nav bar, I expected to be taken back to respective home pages, not the screen where I had last visited (eg veg description) |

_Then explored details of implementation in Rails, in particular how to realise attributes, associations and behaviour. Attribute types, user-defined types. Implemetnat associagtions with multiplicity, variable or collections, then implement operations. 

Implementation of designed solution

create tab navigation
- React Navigation, also starting to understand. Original wanted no tabs showing when initially creating a user, but time boxed that and now going to check whether a user exists then render a different component, so the navigation is the same throughout
- Couldnt get navigation to work with plot vegetable component so changed approach to adding include to back end, so on getting a plot it would also get the plots vegetables info, so that can be renders in the plot pag

create user [story](https://github.com/harrietc52/TM470/issues/59)
- Install redux to persist user - do we need a user? 
- Started Sign up user. Adding scafford for Rails backend and tabs and import basic component in front end
- Struggling with getting error to be thrown, but still get response. Rails.application.config.action\_dispatch.show\_exceptions = true. Commented out in `rails_api_mysql_project/spec/requests/users_spec.rb` for now

https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-get-location


Location on a Plot was initially a user-defined type. However, after accesing the devices location, it was returned as an object with latitude and longitude, and individual big ints. Therefore a Location class isn't required, as it also do not now contain any behaviour, but instead lat and long attributes added to Plot. 

This adds constraint, that plot locations will be assumed to be in south UK, as the frost dates will be hard coded. 
Since TMA02, removed the frost locations, as struggled to find an freely available API based with UK data. frost dates - could not find api. Adding Constraint, assuming used in UK based, specificaitlly cambridgeshire, as frost dates and sow/plant/harvest dates set for all vegetbales the same (as planned for in in Risks) going to stub out the data for now, so can still use hybrid device location to get location and send to backend and store. Then will return with stubbed data about frost dates the same for every location. (covered in risks)

research plug ins


Attributes:
Initially it was decided sow, plant and harvest datas would be attributes on a PlotVegtable object. As it was throught these would be depended on the Plots frost dates. However, as frost dates mocked out, these dates are constant for all vegetables. Therefore the attribute can belong to the Vegetable class. 

Data types:
It wasn't clear how best store the sow, plant and harvest dates
- a range of months (jan - march)
- or a object {sow: [jan, feb, march]}
- or many lists sow: [jan, feb], plant: []
- but lists are hard to store in db
- use index as months, with strings [0,1,1,2,2,...]
    - where 0 is nothng, 1 is sow
- store as stringvole
    - '0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,0,0'
    - parse to list
    - and assign number to task
- could develop further with enum
    - Could improve this to enum though, not int. Where sow = 1, plant 2 etc. if enum would be better 
    - sowKind = TaskKind.SOW;
- could be stored differently as config, and unlikely to change

## Appendix 32

Setting up Cordova proved complex. Cordova requires XCode to run the iOS simulator. I am developing on my work laptop so didn’t have the correct permissions to install XCode. It also required a lot of memory. Firstly, I installed a too recent version of XCode for my operating system. Then, the XCode command line was not picking up the “PATH” of the more recent version.

Cordova in the browser was successfully retrieving the MySQL data. However, the iOS simulation wasn’t. After researching, this was because the simulation had a different origin to my laptop. I had to install a transport security plugin (“Cordova-Plugin-Transport-Security” n.d.) and add a HTTP Content-Security-Policy meta tag in the Vue HTML. (Code fix is shown in the background of Figure 14) (“Allow List Guide - Apache Cordova” n.d.)  this sort of thing can be a nightmare!

This solution took a while because it is impossible to debug the iOS simulator. A post in Stack Overflow suggested developer tools in Safari. Once I found the error in the Safari console, debugging was much quicker.


When developing the React prototype, similar security issues to the Vue prototype resurfaced. I relaxed the CORS constraints in the back-end and added headers to requests, resulting in a different Network error: iOS does not allow HTTP requests. I then served Rails on HTTPS using a Self Signed Certificate. This worked on my laptops emulator but not my phone because the request to "localhost" from my phone, was understandably, not reaching my laptop. 

I updated the request to point to the laptops IP address. The request was now timing out which was progress. A Stack Overflow answer [@rice_answer_2019] solved this exact problem, suggesting binding the Rails server to 0.0.0.0, which was successful as my phone accessed bank-end data over the internet. This internet dependency was confirmed when developing the application in the car. I hotspotted which changed my laptops IP address because of the different network. Updating the front-end request to use the new IP successfully served the back-end data again. 

The development of working prototypes for both Vue Cordova and React Native was a big learning curve. Carrying my learning experiences from one prototype to another was rewarding. I then felt in a strong position to choose between the two, knowing they both fundamentally work.
